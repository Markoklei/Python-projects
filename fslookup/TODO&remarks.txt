add supported extensions and their appropriate functions - right now we have .docx and .txt, which is fine for now, we
might add pdf later on - don't forget to update lists (supported_extensions and search_functions)

finished testing functionality for .txt and .docx - start creating basic GUI with sterm and path input and incorporate
it with rec_search, when this is done, we will add further functionality like selecting the wanted extensions, treating
casing (upper/lower), presenting the found files in a list in the GUI (I want the user to be able to open them and
to open their file location from the GUI), searching for sterm as a whole word rather than substring

-----
to push to the Python_projects repository:
git add <files or simply .>
git commit -m "informative message"
git push origin master


something to consider when deploying the app to other computers later on - will the python docx
module be included or will we get a runtime error? in c the module is only included if we are the ones that wrote it
if I remember correctly
