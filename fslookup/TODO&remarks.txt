add supported extensions and their appropriate functions - right now we have .docx and .txt, which is fine for now, we
might add pdf later on - don't forget to update lists (supported_extensions and search_functions)

initial smoke testing for .txt extension went ok, use the 'Testing fslookup' folder in desktop for further testing:
try adding a folder in 'Testing fslookup' and see if the code can find appropriate files in it (so far the testing
folder is of depth 1, try adding subfolders and see what happens)

read about mmap, bytearray and StringIO object (tabs are open for the former two)
-----
to push to the Python_projects repository:
git add <files or simply .>
git commit -m "informative message"
git push origin master


something to consider when deploying the app to other computers later on - will the python docx
module be included or will we get a runtime error? in c the module is only included if we are the ones that wrote it
if I remember correctly
